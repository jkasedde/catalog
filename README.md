Python Photo Catalog App

This project is meant to be a photo gallery app that can be used to download photos from the net.

The application currently has bugs and i would welcome any help with the following 

1. Instead of every user being redirected to their own gallery they should all be redirected to the main catalog index page 
2. Adding a download option which saves files as PDFs 

Thanks
